## 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order,
and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

> **Input**:: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4] <br/>
> **Output**: [7,0,8] <br/>
> **Explanation**: 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

> **Input**: nums = [3,3], target = 6 <br/>
> **Output**: [0,1]

**Example 3:**

> **Input**: l1 = [0], l2 = [0] <br/>
> **Output**: [0]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
